# Roadmap for minio-link

## Last update: 28th October 2023

- list stored objects / links => combination of existing yourls links (filter by title) and minio object store
- other config options than .env
- get stored objects after list => option to regenerate links for existing objects if link expired (default: 7d)
- make links last longer than 7 days?
